# Kubernetes manifest collection

This is a collection of kubernetes manifets which I use in my labs and my [blog content](https://rodrigobaron.com). They are in static manifest for learning purpose in a production enviroment should consider [helm charts](https://helm.sh/) or [kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) for easier management.
